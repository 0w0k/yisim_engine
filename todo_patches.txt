the following cards and effects have been patched in the game but not in yisim:
Clear Heart Sword Formation
Heavenly Marrow Gourd
Star Moon Hexagram Fan
Styx Night Footwork
Crash Fist - Return to Xuan
Thousand Star Explosion
Unceasing Universe

· Ultimate Overcome Formation（Du Lingyuan）：The trigger timing has been changed from "after use" to "upon use". This will allow Wood Spirit - Fragrant and Water Spirit - Great Waves to receive a Qi bonus when triggered.

Some of these have been patched multiple times, so it's best to check the effect in game instead of copying it from the patch notes.

implementation note: Xuanming Recover Elixir and snowdrop can bring you back to life if you have hp < 0
